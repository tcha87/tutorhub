<span>How can I contact the tutor(s) of my choice to get their contact information?</span></div><div><p>
	Searching for tutors is done from the search engine present in the top of each page of the website. Once the tutor(s) is (are) selected, the student can contact the tutor&nbsp;by clicking on the button "Reserve a private lesson," under the tutor's photo. Once the message is sent to the tutor, it is necessary that he/she accepts the current request for the details to be forwarded to the student.
</p></div></li><li><div>
<span
class="dot"></span>
<span>How can I be sure that the tutors I have chosen are competent?</span></div><div><h4>Clarity and transparency of profiles</h4><p>
	We ask our tutors to be as transparent as possible when writing their listings, detailing their profiles through three distinct categories: Experience, Teaching and Curriculum Vitae.
</p><h4>Verification of personal data and information provided </h4><p>
	Tutors are required to provide us their certificates and/or degrees that we verify under 24 hours. We also control their contact information (phone, email, photo) so that the the first meeting is facilitated.
</p><h4>Measuring the interactions with students</h4><p>
	On the listing of each tutor, the response rate (i.e. 100%) and response time (i.e. several hours) are displayed and updated in real time. Students can also see when has last connected to his/her Superprof account, indicating that he/she is active on the website.
</p><h4>Evaluations by students and peers</h4><p>
	Reviews of former students and recommendations from peers, published in their listings, help to form an opinion on the quality and style of the lessons given by the tutors.
</p></div></li><li><div>
<span
class="dot"></span>
<span>How do you manage to always propose available tutors?</span></div><div><p>
	Super Prof has implemented a system for measuring the availability of real-time professors, and an analysis of responses to other students.
</p></div></li><li><div>
<span
class="dot"></span>
<span>How much does the service cost?</span></div><div><h4>Contacting a teacher is the only cost</h4><p>
	The cost of connecting is £19 and exclusively the responsibility of the student who will contact as many tutors in as many subjects that he/she wishes, over a period of 30 days. Note that the first lesson is very often offered free of charge by the tutor.
</p><h4>The debit is only made when the selected tutor accepts your request</h4><p>
	However, you can choose to contact several tutors simultaneously, obtain their contact information, and then select the one that suits you best.
</p></div></li><li><div>
<span

<span>Is payment by credit card Superprof secure, and how?</span></div><div><p>
	We are extremely vigilant about the security of payments on the site. A payment on our website is as secure as credit card payments in a physical outlet.
</p><p>
	By paying via credit card on Superprof, you enjoy the latest security technologies.
</p><p>
	Once on the payment page, you enter your card number on an encrypted page with a 128-bit SSL certificate - the safest in the market - and secured by https - the beginning of the site address "http://www" shown at the top of the screen changes to “https://www”. A closed padlock appears next to the URL in the browser.
</p><p>
	The credit card information is not stored, retained or printed on paper and it is our provider PAYBOX that will authorize the payment according reinforced criteria.
</p><p>
	Finally, the payment ends up in the bank account of Superprof Crédit Mutuel.
</p></div></li><li><div>
<span
class="dot"></span>
<span>I do not wish to pay by credit card, can I pay by other means?</span></div><div><p>
	It is possible to pay by check. You can write it in the order of Superprof and we send it to:
</p><p>
	SUPERPROF
	<br>
	16 esplanade Nathalie Sarraute
	<br>
	75018 PARIS –&nbsp;FRANCE

<span

<span>Why have tutors that I did not contact receive my lesson requests?</span></div><div><p>
	If the initial request of the student has not been completed after 48 hours, Superprof offers students other profiles of tutors relative to their needs, according to the same criteria (subject, location, rate) and offers the first lesson for free.
</p><p>
	In this manner, we would like students and parents to increase their chances of finding a tutor most fitting for their search.
</p></div></li><li><div>
<span
class="dot"></span>
